# Baby Growth Tracker: The Ultimate Tool for Monitoring Your Infant's Development

## Detailed Description  
The Baby Growth Tracker is a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet designed to help parents and caregivers meticulously record and visualize their infant's growth metrics. This tool automatically tracks weight (in pounds/ounces), length (in inches), and percentile rankings from birth through 36 months. With built-in growth charts, it transforms raw data into easy-to-understand visual progress reports, eliminating the guesswork from developmental monitoring. Pediatricians recommend regular growth tracking to ensure healthy development, and this template provides hospital-grade accuracy for home use.

## Use Cases  
- New parents documenting their baby's first 3 years  
- Pediatric clinics maintaining digital growth records  
- Grandparents tracking grandchildren's milestones remotely  
- Researchers analyzing infant growth patterns  

## Key Features  
• **Dual Measurement System**: Supports both imperial (lbs/oz) and percentile rankings  
• **Auto-Charting**: Generates visual growth curves from entered data  
• **Developmental Benchmarks**: Pre-populated with WHO standard checkpoints  
• **Error Handling**: Flags abnormal measurements (#N/A placeholder for missing data)  
• **Mobile-Friendly**: Works on Excel mobile app for on-the-go updates  

## How to Use  
1. **Download** the Excel file to your device  
2. **Enter Data**:  
   - Fill in baby's name and birth date  
   - Input weight/length at each checkup  
3. **View Charts**: The growth chart auto-updates with new entries  
4. **Share**: Export as PDF for pediatrician visits  

## FAQ  
**Q: How often should I update the tracker?**  
A: Recommended after each well-baby visit (typically at 2 weeks, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months).  

**Q: Why do some cells show #N/A?**  
A: These are placeholders for future measurements - they'll populate as you add data.  

**Q: Can I track multiple children?**  
A: Yes! Simply duplicate the worksheet for each child.
