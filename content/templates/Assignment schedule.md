《Assignment Schedule.xlsx》is an education-focused task tracking spreadsheet designed for students, instructors, or training coordinators.

The PivotTable supports dynamic refresh, while slicers enable quick filtering by course (e.g., Basic Life Support), instructor, progress percentage (0%-100%), or due date (e.g., due in 2 days). Ideal for monitoring strict deadlines in medical training (e.g., EMT, Anatomy).
