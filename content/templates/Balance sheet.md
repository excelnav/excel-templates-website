## ​5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)​​
​Q1: Is a balloon loan risky?​​
​A: It depends. Balloon loans offer lower monthly payments but require a large lump-sum payment at the end. Ensure you have a refinancing or repayment plan in place.

​Q2: Can I refinance a balloon payment?​​
​A: Yes, but refinancing depends on credit scores and market rates at the balloon term. Always consult a financial advisor.

​Q3: What happens if I can’t pay the balloon amount?​​
​A: Defaulting may lead to asset repossession (e.g., car or property). Explore refinancing or selling the asset beforehand.
