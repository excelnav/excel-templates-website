# Baby Shower Planner Template: Organize the Perfect Celebration Effortlessly  

## Detailed Description  
This Baby Shower Planner Excel template is designed to streamline every aspect of your baby shower event planning. It includes dedicated sections for guest management (tracking RSVPs, addresses, and party size), budget tracking (food/drinks, decorations, supplies), and task scheduling with time-sensitive reminders. The template features pre-formatted tables with auto-calculated totals, hidden instructional notes for guidance, and a clean layout for easy data entry. Ideal for hosts who want to avoid oversights, it ensures no detail is missed—from sending invitations to the final walkthrough before guests arrive.  

## Use Cases  
- Planning a surprise baby shower for a family member.  
- Coordinating a co-ed baby shower with multiple hosts.  
- Budget-conscious organizers tracking expenses across categories.  

## Key Features  
✔ **Guest List Manager**: Track RSVPs, relationships, and addresses in one table.  
✔ **Budget Tracker**: Auto-summed costs for food, decorations, and supplies.  
✔ **Task Scheduler**: Time-stamped to-do list with progress notes.  
✔ **Hidden Tips**: Column A contains pro tips (press `Shift+F10` in a table to access).  

## How to Use  
1. **Enter Event Basics**: Fill in "For," "When," and "Where" at the top.  
2. **Add Guests**: Populate the GUESTS table with names, RSVPs, and party size.  
3. **Log Expenses**: Input costs under FOOD/DRINKS, DECORATIONS, and OTHER SUPPLIES.  
4. **Schedule Tasks**: Assign dates (Excel serial numbers) and notes in the TASK LIST.  
5. **Review Totals**: Check auto-calculated sums at the bottom of each expense table.  

## FAQ  
**Q: How do I unhide the instructions?**  
A: Column A contains hidden text. Select the column, right-click, and choose "Unhide."  

**Q: Why are task dates displayed as numbers?**  
A: Excel uses serial numbers for dates. Format cells as "Date" (e.g., `10/13/2023`) for readability.

A: Yes! Right-click a table row, select "Insert," and maintain the table structure.
